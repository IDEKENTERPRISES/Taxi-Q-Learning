# CS4049-assessment-2

***This assessment consists of 5 subtasks:***

1. Implement the _epsilon-greedy_ method for the Taxi Environment using OpenAI Gym.

2. Design a neural network using the epsilon-greedy method.

3. Discuss how the environment adapts via rewards, with plots and graphs.

4. Train another neural network using a better, more suitable method, for the Taxi environment, **managing exploitation-exploration** better. 

5. Discuss and compare both methods, using graphs to illustrate the **average amount of rewards** over time. 

## Initialisation: 

_The packages required are:_
- OpenAI Gym for the test environment.
- Tensorflow + Keras to generate the neural networks.
- Matplotlib for graphing.
